        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white">What we keep</h2>
        <p>
          Your browser gets a random, anonymous ID so the app can remember your progress. If you sign in with Google, we
          keep your name and email address (nothing else from your Google account) to recognise you on every device and,
          during the invite-only beta, to know who invited whom. With that ID we store:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>your streak, sparks, XP and unlocked series;</li>
          <li>your brand settings;</li>
          <li>posts you publish, including their images;</li>
          <li>custom personas you create;</li>
          <li>reflections you choose to save to your journal;</li>
          <li>your invite codes and whether they've been used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you join the waitlist, we keep that email address only to send you an invite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your prompts and images are sent to Google's Gemini models to create the pictures and captions. We use daily
          usage counts to keep the free service fair. We don't sell your data or show ads.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you use "How are you today?", what you write is sent to Google (to find and write words that fit) and to
          TypeSafe's JEV (to check the reply for predictions, promises and made-up quotes). It isn't stored unless you
          save it to your journal.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="space-y-2">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white">AI-generated content</h2>
        <p>
          Images and captions are made by AI and can be wrong, odd or unoriginal. Quotes are attributed to their
          authors with a modern reading; check them before you rely on them. Review everything before you post it, and
          don't use Inspire to create content that is harmful, misleading or that infringes someone else's rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflections are written by AI from a hand-picked library of real, credited words. They are not therapy or
          medical advice, and Inspire never predicts the future. If you are in crisis, call the NCMH Crisis Hotline at
          1553 (Philippines) or your local emergency number.

      <section className="space-y-2">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white">Fair use</h2>
        <p>
          Inspire is free during this preview, with daily limits on images and posts. Features may change. The service
          is provided as is.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white">Delete my data</h2>
        <p>
          This permanently deletes your progress, settings, saved posts, their images, your journal and your personas from our
          servers, and unlinks your Google account. You'll start fresh. During the invite-only beta you'd need a new
          invite to come back.
